My Arduino Playground
=====================

Here are some of my Arduino projects.
Some are done. Others will be developed and others are only Ideas.
Feel free to contribute your Ideas, make the Code better.
Or think "FTW!! What a cool Project. Wow!"
Some others of thesee projects may give you useful ideas, some are utterly pointless but most of them will ... think our own.
